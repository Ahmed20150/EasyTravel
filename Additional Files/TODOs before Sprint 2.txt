These TODOs should be completed by all team members that it applies to BEFORE starting in sprint 2 requirements, so that these updates can be merged on the main branch and all team members are on the same page.

1. Adjust File Structure: 
    1.1 any CSS file be in CSS folder
    1.2 any routes that are in index.js should be placed in a routes folder of their own
    1.3 any routes folder that is not named in this convention: [file_name].routes.js should be renamed

2. Adjust CSS: No stylesheets should have global elements, use classes instead of direct styling on global elements. All Stylesheets were commented in sprint 1 because of this (Except museumList.css), everyone should fix this issue and we can uncomment them. (Exception for museumList.css: The button elements in it have been moved to App.css in order to be applied globaly on the entire application)

3. Certain Logic in certain stories was mainly implemented in the frontend files, and it shouldve been implemented in the backend routes instead.
