**Rules**:
1. All Error messages need to be displayed either by alerts or toastify 
2. Any and all forms should be in their dedictaed page/popup, and NOT displayed on top of a view page
3. The needed inputs & their formats should be clear to the user (hint messages, form labels, dropdown lists when inputs that specific )
4. all elements should ahdere to the color scheme present in landing page, login & sign up pages.
5. no one is allowed to create their own css stylesheet, instead you can find below an alternative way that serves the same purpose
6. no one is to write any css stylings in app.css or index.css
7. Frontend should be tested after implementation to make sure no logic is broken.
8. *NO ONE* is allowed to change anything in the globalStyles without confirming with the rest of the team
9. any and all buttons should be from GeneralStyles.js
10. any and all buttons in the *HOME PAGE ONLY* should be made using HomeCard Component 
11. Back buttons need to be present in ALL PAGES

**HomeCard Component**
-Ready to use component used for all buttons in home page.
-Accepts 4 parameters:
1. title: title of card 
2. description: short description of card
3. linkRoute: route that the  card redirects to when pressed
4. imageSrc: link to image that would be displayed on card (this field is not required, could be not written)


**General Tips**:
1. Use pre-defined components from the component library "flowbite-react", website: https://flowbite-react.com/docs/components/accordion

**Alternative to CSS Stylesheets: Style Files*
Instead of using stylesheets, I have created a file for each individual in the "styles" folder with their name, as well as a global style file. 
These files will serve as our alternatives to stylehseets, because they are js files and not css stylehseets, you need to import the specific 
style that you will use explicitly, which decreseas chance of any confusion. Moreover, if two imported styles have teh same name, the compiler 
will not accept that, which helps us in avoiding any conflicts in styling. 

**How to use Style files**
1. import needed styles from your personal/global style file: import {buttonStyle} from "../styles/GlobalStyles"; 
2. add imported style as a className for whatever element needed: <Button className={buttonStyle}> Get Started </Button>


**How to use Toastify (instead of alerts)**
1. Import toast & ToastContainer: import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify';
2. import toast css styling: import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css';
3. add ToastContainer to any part of the code after the return (the Html part of the code):  <ToastContainer/>
4. Call your notification with whatever message is required (just like alerts): toast.success("Task Completed!") / toast.error*("Task Failed!")
(there is also toast.info, find more variants at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify/v/4.1.0)
