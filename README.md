# Easytravel

## Motivation
This application aims to enhance the user experience by seamlessly connecting tourists, advertisers, tour guides, sellers, and tourism governors. It simplifies processes such as activity and itinerary bookings, e-commerce product sales, and the management of complaints and notifications, all within a unified system. Designed as the backbone of an integrated travel and tourism platform, it streamlines both administrative tasks and user-facing operations.
